# üéÆ OpenQUIZ Game
Create your own QUIZ server game with a simple management API. This project is in an early stage and can be an Open Source alternative to other QUIZ team games like Kahoot. This is a new version refactored to simplify the structure of Rest API, Routes and endpoints and many more other simplified schemes to speedup, and make this API 100% compliance with OpenAPI Specifications.

In time...I change from old loved Flask RestAPI, to FastAPI + Hypercorn framework and support to HTTP/3 and QUIC with Python aioquic library. FastAPI is a framework with high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production üöÄ

## üñ®Ô∏è Technologies
- [x] üñ•Ô∏è Containers ( podman, docker, rancher desktop and others)
- [x] üíæ MongoDB ( Data Persist )
- [x] üêç Python w/ FastAPI ( Support to HTTP/3 and QUIC )
- [X] üìÉ SwaggerUI for API Documentation
- [x] üåê HTML 3.0 and CSS ( Frontend )
- [ ] üß™ Maybe... RabbitMQ ( Queue )

## ü™í In development
- Frontend for Admin
- Frontend for Logged Players
  - Player Profile
    - Preferred Themes
    - About Me
    - Social Media Share
  - Game Community
    - Friend List
    - Random QUIZZES
  - Scoreboard for played QUIZZES
  - Random Create Trivias
- Frontend for Ephemeral Players
- OAUTH / SSO Login with Google

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
>[!IMPORTANT]
> You need to select MongoDB version in .env ( instructions inside than )... MongoDB 5.0 needs a CPU with AVX support, and with some old processors like XEON X5680 ( my fully functional old macpro 5,1 for example ), cannot be run it. Then I made 2 versions of compose.

```bash
### This example use MongoDB 5.5.
### Build the stack and be happy üéâ

$ docker compose -f docker-compose-mongo4.4.yml -up -d --build
```

## üß™ How can I test?
>[!NOTE]
>At this time no one update yours API Test tools ( like postman or insomnia ), to support HTTP/3 or QUIC. Then... use everything UI you want, I preffer Postman, and put into root of this repo, a Postman Collection with all you need. "And All You need is ‚ù§Ô∏è " - Lennon. John ü™≤

>[!TIP]
>But... if you wanna make great tests in shell, use CURL with --http3 support! read more around the internet, how can you install it for your OS.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Above, endpoint, routes and payloads to test OpenQUIZ API Rest.
